        notes: "The character named Jesus states 3 ways for a male to be castrated (testicles removed) and then states that if the male can do so, that they should be castrated to avoid husband and wife divorce and adultery issues. Isaiah 56:3-5 clearly states that Eunuch means castrated male.",

        notes: "When they state 'dry tree' and 'will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters', that means they are castrated males who cannot have offspring since they have no testicles (eunuchs).",
