        description: "Leviticus 25:44-46 (KJV) 44 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids. 45 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession. 46 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.",

        notes: "It does not say that when the messiah comes that the slavery would end! Thus, the reason that verse needs to be removed is because it is actually promoting ETERNAL SLAVERY of buying children and entire families, if they do NOT descend from the MAN named Israel, who used to be named Jacob.",
